## ðŸš€ Overview of Assignments

### âœ… Assignment 1 â€“ Cryptanalysis & Password Security  
- **Cryptanalysis:** Broke monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using dictionary matching, quadgram scoring, and heuristics.  
- **Password Security:** Cracked salted and unsalted MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes using a large word frequency corpus (5.6M words).

---

### âœ… Assignment 2 â€“ Key Exchange Security & Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)  
- **Key Exchange Security:** Analyzed Diffieâ€“Hellman vulnerabilities and weak parameter choices by capturing traffic with Wireshark.  
- **MITM Attacks:** Executed Man-in-the-Middle attacks using iptables, ARP spoofing, and host poisoning to intercept and manipulate network traffic.

---

### âœ… Assignment 3 â€“ Memory and System Safety  
- Exploited buffer overflows and return-to-libc vulnerabilities in C web servers.  
- Developed and applied security patches to fix the vulnerabilities.

---

### âœ… Assignment 4 â€“ DDoS and Port Scan Detection  
- **DDoS Detection:** Identified large-scale distributed denial-of-service attacks using probabilistic data structures (HyperLogLog, Bloom Filter).  
- **Port Scan Detection:** Detected horizontal and vertical port scans by analyzing over 2M network flows using Countâ€“Min Sketch.

---

### âœ… Assignment 5 â€“ TLS & Web Security  
- Built a custom TLS client for certificate validation.  
- Performed automated web scanning using Nmap and Nikto to detect SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
